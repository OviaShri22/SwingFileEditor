This project introduces a user-friendly, GUI-based Java File Editor developed using the Swing framework.
The application enables users to perform essential text editing operations such as creating new files, opening existing ones, editing content, and saving changes efficiently.
By leveraging buffered input/output streams, the editor ensures optimized performance for reading from and writing to text files, even those with large content sizes.
The editor includes several usability-focused features to enhance the user experience. 
These include undo and redo actions for editing flexibility, real-time display of word and character counts to assist users in tracking content length, and a built-in 
search function with keyword highlighting to make locating specific text faster and more visually accessible. Additionally, the application allows dynamic switching between
light and dark modes to suit various user preferences and environments, and supports font resizing for better readability and accessibility.
A key goal of the project is to offer a lightweight and standalone desktop application that can be easily executed on different platforms by packaging it into a portable JAR file. 
The project also demonstrates effective implementation of core Java concepts such as object-oriented design, event-driven programming, and modular Swing component usage.
In summary, this Java File Editor combines functionality and simplicity, providing an efficient platform for everyday text editing tasks while also serving as a practical example of Java GUI application development.
